# Configuration file for EmojiChat by RadBuilder

# EmojiChat collects metrics in order to get a better understanding of what configurations are used.
# Statistics include how many servers it's being used on and what version of Bukkit/Spigot they're using,
# how many players are using it, server information such as Java version, how many emojis are used,
# and how many servers are using each feature. This data is anonymous, and is submitted to understand what
# types of server configurations are being used to build a better plugin (i.e. MC/Java versions to continue supporting,
# features to keep/remove). Data collection has very little/no impact on server performance. I'd appreciate if you
# keep this set to FULL, but I completely understand if you want to send less data or opt out.
#
# 'FULL'  collects what 'SOME' collects, and data on what config options you're using.
# 'SOME'  collects what 'BASIC' collects, and what hooks you're using.
# 'BASIC' collects data on what Java version you're using, Bukkit/Spigot version you're using, other general server
#         information like player count, how many emojis you've used, and shortcuts you've used.
# 'OFF'   collects NO DATA, however, I would appreciate it if you send at least basic data.
metrics-collection: 'FULL'

# If you're using chat color plugins, this will remove the coloring for emojis to be displayed correctly.
fix-emoji-coloring: false

# Aliases for emoji command

# If emojis should be displayed on signs (shortcuts and full names supported).
emojis-on-signs: false

# If commands should have emojis (shortcuts and full names supported).
emojis-in-commands: false
# If emojis should ONLY work with commands in 'command-list'.
only-command-list: false
# If 'only-command-list' is true, the commands here will be the only commands where emojis are allowed.

# If EmojiChat should auto download the ResourcePack. If you'd rather have your players manually
# download or use /emojichat resourcepack, set this to false.
download-resourcepack: true
# The resource pack variant to use.
# 1 replaces Korean characters with emojis, and 2 replaces Chinese characters with emojis.
# WARNING: Changing this will ruin things like signs that already have the other language's characters!
# Don't change this unless your normal language is being overwritten by emojis.
# Variant 2 is now default because of https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-41270 .
pack-variant: 2
# If the resource pack should be 'HD' (High Definition) or 'SD' (Standard Definition).
# HD textures aren't compatible with Minecraft (not server) versions 1.13+,
# and will result in emojis not being displayed correctly.
# If you're using a server that supports any Minecraft versions including 1.13+, use SD.
# Otherwise use HD for better quality.
# The file size difference between HD and SD packs is extremely small, and shouldn't
# be a factor when choosing which pack to use.
pack-quality: 'SD'

# Shortcuts will replace the items in the list with the correct emoji name.
# For example, :) will be replaced with :grinning:, which then will turn it into the emoji.
